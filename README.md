# HappyScore
### 1. Clone the Repository
###### To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.

###### This URL will be similar to the URL above, except now it will end with .git. In the example above, the URL will look like this:

https://github.com/PratikAgrawal02/HappyScore

###### You can alternatively copy the URL by using the green “Clone or download” button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. Once you click the button, you’ll be able to copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL:

###### Once we have the URL, we’re ready to clone the repository. To do this, we’ll combine the git clone command with the repository URL from the command line in a terminal window:
```
git clone https://github.com/PratikAgrawal02/HappyScore.git
```

### 2. Download Android Studio
